*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by iabiesat*

## Description:
in this project we explore the beauty of mathematical sets such as **NANDELBROT** & **JULIA**

## Instructions:
the goal is to understand how to work with mlx library and learn more about complex number, fractal generation.
you will learn how to manipulate images pixel by pixel implement keyboard and mouse event

### about mlx
the mlx library is a small graphic library, it allows you 
- open a win
- create an image buffer
- access raw pixel data
- draw each pixel depend on the fractal calculation
- respond to keyboard and mouse event
- update the win with the rendering image

### prerequisites
Make \
clang or another C compiler

### usage
clone the repo and move inside the file

```
make
./fractol julia -0.4 0.6
```
#### or

```
./fractol mandelbrot
```

### control
- c -> change color scheme
- Mouse Wheel -> Zoom in/out
- Arrow key-> move/pan

- ESC -> close the window

## About using AI:
AI tool such as (chatgpt, claude and copilot) to create general roadmap on how to start and what should to learn and to organize the program, also it was helpful with bug that i faced during build the program
